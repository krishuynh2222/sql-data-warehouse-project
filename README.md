## üìñ Project Overview
This project involves:
1. **Data Architecture**: Designing a Modern Data Warehouse Using Medallion Architecture Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers.
2. **ETL Pipelines**: Extracting, transforming, and loading data from source systems into the warehouse.
3. **Data Modeling**: Developing fact and dimension tables optimized for analytical queries.
4. **Analytics & Reporting**: Creating SQL-based reports and dashboards for actionable insights.

## üöÄ Project Requirements

### Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)

#### Objective 
Develop a modern data warehouse using PostgreSQL to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making. 

#### Specifications
- **Data Sources**: Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files
- **Data Quality**: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues before the analysis phase.
- **Integration**: Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical
- **Scope**: Focus on the lastest dataset only; historizaition of data is not required
- **Documentation**: Provide detailed documentation of the data model to support business stakeholders and analytics teams.

1. **Bronze Layer**: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into the PostgreSQL Database.
2. **Silver Layer**: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
3. **Gold Layer**: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.
